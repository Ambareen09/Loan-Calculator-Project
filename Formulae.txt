1. Differential Payment (Dm) = p/n + i * (P - (P*(m-1)/n))

2. Annuity Payment (A) = P * (i*(1+i)^n)/((1+i)^n - 1)

3. Monthly Payment (Pay) = P/n

4. Last Payment = P - (n-1) * (Pay)

5. Principal (P) = A * ((1+i)^n - 1)/(i * (1+i)^n)

6. No. of period or No of months (n) = Log(base i+1) (A/(A-i*P))

7. Rate of interest (i) = 1/12 th of interest rate = r/(12*100)
